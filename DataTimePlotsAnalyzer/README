Instructions to plot timing fromt he HLT objects

In your favorite cmsrel src area:
git clone --recursive git@github.com:ssantpur/DataHLTPlots.git
scram b -j 8
cd DataHLTPlots/DataTimePlotsAnalyzer

Update the input file location in ConfFile_cfg_2026.py , currently set to run over a hlt.root file that I produced in the Prod folder of the SteamWorkflow

Command to run:
cmsRun ConfFile_cfg_2026.py

This will produce hltcalojet four vectors, time, ncells, ecalet etc histograms that are saved in an out.root file. The output file also contains which events passed a particular delayed jet trigger.

Get in touch if you have any questions. Happy triggering!
